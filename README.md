# The idea
The idea of this script, is provide a set of practical tools which will allow the user to extract metrics which are useful to observe either indiviudal assets or compare pairs/groups of them. Going through the code step by step, the user will have access to some metrics which are practical when doing portfolio analysis, hedging, market strategies among other research.

## How are we going to do it?

It will be focused 100% on the practical aspects, easy to use and with references to theoretical content when needed. The user will be able to use the script only by modifiying the assets on the cell dedicated to it.

This script pretends to be the first of a series where we provide a toolbox over the first steps on asset comparison analysis and other common topics what you can read on What's comming next section.
